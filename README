A "phonetic" keymap for Cyrillic, for use under UTF-8 encoding.

This is the keymap I use when I type Russian in gvim; it may or may not suit you. For instance, it uses several "dead keys" which might take some getting used to. Or you might want to use it as a starting point, then alter it to suit your tastes.
